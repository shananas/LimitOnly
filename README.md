# LimitOnly

Play as Limit Form the whole time. (Except Pride Lands and Atlantica)

You must either start a New Game or load a save where you have obtained all forms to prevent crashing due to forms missing Keyblades.

You have Max Level growth of other forms if starting a new game. If you do not want to have this open the mod.yml in a text editor and scroll down to the bottom where it says `#Delete everything below if you dont want growth from other forms` and delete everything below this line before starting a new game.

If you want to play without KH2Randomizer you must also install `shananas/FormOnlyVanillaCompanion` and place it above this mod.
